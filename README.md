Hi, this is my Artic project for Code The Dream.
It has 2 models(Artworks and Products). So basically you will see data from 'https://api.artic.edu'.

Wanna see it?)
Here are the steps you should follow:
  -git clone 'my_repository'
  -cd artic_project
  -grab/open index.html to any webBrowser
  -enjoy!!!```

NOTE: I don't know why, but sometimes fetching take a long time, that's why you should wait longer:)
