**Hi, I am Adil Akakov.**
This is my Artic project for **Code The Dream**.

It has 2 models(Artworks and Products). 

So basically you will see data from [Artic Website](https://api.artic.edu/docs/).

Wanna see it?)

Here are the steps you should follow:
````

git clone 'my_repository'

cd artic_project

````

>**grab/open index.html to any webBrowser**

>**enjoy**!!!


**NOTE: I don't know why, but sometimes fetching take a long time, that's why you should wait longer:)**
